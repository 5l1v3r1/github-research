Theano:
-Released 04/02/2009
-“Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language.”
-Created by a small academic team, development has grown significantly. ~22,000 commits, 211 contributors. Qualitatively, high community driven development.
-Built on top of other open source projects, BSD license here: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/LICENSE.html
-No commit license, copyright consolidated.

Caffe:
-Based off of older project “caffeine”, released github on Sept 8, 2013.
